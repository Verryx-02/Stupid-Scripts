# Stupid-Scripts

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, here you can find some useful scripts I use for doing trivial things.

Here is a list of projects with a little explanation:  
- count_go_code_lines.py: Given a folder, it recursively explores it looking for files with the .go extension and counts the lines in those files.
Returns: 
- the total number of rows counted
- the number of comment lines
- the number of empty lines
- the number of code line (without empty and comment lines)
